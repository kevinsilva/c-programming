# TV Audience

The aim of this work is for trainees to use:

- Decision structures and conditional repetition.
- Compound data types: array's and strings.
- Input data must be validated.

A TV channel audience survey was carried out in several households in a certain city, on a certain day. For each house visited, the channel number (1, 2, 3, 4) and the number of people watching in that house were provided. Consider the possibility of having more than one television turned on in the same house.

Houses where there are no TVs on are not included in the percentages. Design a program that:

- Read the number of people watching each channel in each household surveyed.
- Write the total number of homes surveyed with TV on.
- Calculate and write the audience percentage for each TV channel.
- Calculate and write the percentage of tunes on each channel.

Note: You must divide the code into several functions (those you deem necessary) in order to structure and organize the program well.

Clarity in the code, indentation and comments in the program are of great importance.

## Development

To start the application:

```bash
cd tv-audience
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
