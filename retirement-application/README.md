# Retirement Application

A company wants to verify that an employee is eligible for retirement. To qualify, one of the following requirements must be met:

- Be at least 65 years old.
- Have worked for at least 30 years.
- Be at least 60 years old and have worked for at least 25 years.

The employee's number, year of birth and year of joining the company are entered. The program must validate the input data.

The program must present the employee's age and length of service and indicate whether or not this employee can apply for retirement.

Repeat the process until the user does not want to enter any more data.

## Development

To start the application:

```bash
cd retirement-application
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
