# Vending Hot Drinks

The aim of this work is for trainees to use:

- Decision structures and conditional repetition.
- Compound data types: array's and strings.
- Input data must be validated.

Create a program that allows you to simulate the operation of a vending machine for different types of hot drinks. The cost of each product is as follows:

- coffee: €0.25
- cappuccino: €0.30
- Chocolate: €0.35
- Tea – €0.20

- A menu of options should be displayed so that the user can choose his drink.
- The machine accepts €0.05, €0.10, €0.20, €0.50, €1 and €2 coins.
- The customer has the possibility to buy several drinks with the money introduced.
- Returned change must contain as few coins as possible and explain which coins are returned.

Note: You must divide the code into several functions (those you deem necessary) in order to structure and organize the program well.

Clarity in the code, indentation and comments in the program are of great importance.

## Development

To start the application:

```bash
cd vending-hot-drinks
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
