# Presidential Voting

. In a presidential election there are four candidates. Votes are entered using codes. The data used to count the votes obey the following codification:

- 1,2,3,4: vote for the respective candidates;
- 5: blank vote;
- Other: null vote;

  Write a program that reads candidate code. Calculate and write:

- Total votes for each candidate;
- Total null votes;
- Total blank votes;
- Which candidate is the winner. In case of a tie, tell which are the tied candidates;

  End the poll with a value of zero. The program should validate the input data.
